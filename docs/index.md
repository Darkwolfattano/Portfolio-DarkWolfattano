## About Me

I am a programmer with 12 years of experience. I am currently working on my Bachelors in Software engineering. I started with C++, Python, C#. I've worked with some notable groups such as NorthWind studios, Attano Studios, and a few others. 




### Princeples in Code

=== "OOP"
    I use OOP whenever possible, this allows for more modular and expandable code. 
=== "Libaries" 
    I do not belive in reinventing the wheel unless nessacary. Using libaries allows me to finish your project faster and cheaper without any dropp in quality.
=== "SOLID"
    I follow all Solid programming principles. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">Read about Solid Here</a>
