## About Me

As a passionate game developer with over 12 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in creating immersive Roblox experiences that captivate players and drive engagement. Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, I bring a unique blend of academic knowledge and real-world expertise to every project. My journey began with C++, Python, and C#, and has evolved into a deep specialization in Lua and Roblox game development. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of collaborating with industry-recognized studios including NorthWind Studios and Attano Studios, where I've contributed to projects ranging from medieval world-building experiences to innovative tower defense mechanics.



### Princeples in Code

My development philosophy centers around three core principles that ensure scalable, maintainable, and efficient code:


=== "OOP"
    I leverage OOP principles to create modular, reusable systems that scale seamlessly as projects grow. This approach enables easier debugging, better code organization, and more intuitive collaboration with team members.
=== "Libaries" 
    I believe in working smarter, not harder. By incorporating proven, well-maintained libraries, I accelerate development timelines and reduce costs while maintaining exceptional code quality. Why reinvent the wheel when robust solutions already exist?
=== "SOLID"
   My code adheres to all SOLID programming principles, ensuring that every system I build is maintainable, testable, and adaptable to future requirements. This commitment to best practices means your project will stand the test of time." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank">Read about Solid Here</a>
