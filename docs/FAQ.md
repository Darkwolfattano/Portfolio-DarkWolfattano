I offer flexible, transparent pricing structures designed to accommodate projects of all sizes and budgets. My rates are calculated using multiple metrics to ensure you receive fair, competitive pricing tailored to your specific needs.

###  <span style="color: White;">**Pricing** </span> 

=== "Hourly"
    Standard hourly rate: <span style="font-size: 150%;">$14</span> USD per hour. This rate may be adjusted slightly depending on the project’s complexity, scope, and expected duration.
​
=== "Total"
    I also offer project‑based and task‑based pricing. From the start, we agree on the scope, and I provide a prioritized task list with a clear price for each item.
=== "You Reached out to me"
   If I reached out to you, it means the rate you posted is the rate I considered fair for the scope of work.
​
=== "Percent Pay"
   Unless we have a prior agreement in place, I do not accept percentage‑based compensation unless the game is already generating consistent, demonstrable revenue.

### <span style="color: White;"> **What can you do?**</span>
___
My versatility as a developer means I can tackle virtually any Roblox development challenge you present. Whether you need complex game mechanics, intricate UI systems, multiplayer networking, or custom scripting solutions, I have the skills and determination to deliver. <br>If I encounter something new, I approach it with enthusiasm and quickly master the necessary techniques. I believe in transparent communication—if I haven't built something before, I'll tell you honestly, but I've consistently proven my ability to learn and implement new systems efficiently. My track record speaks for itself: challenges are just opportunities for innovation.

###  <span style="color: White;"> **Communication** </span>
___
Professional communication is a cornerstone of my work ethic. I maintain daily contact with clients throughout project development,<br> keeping you informed of progress, challenges, and milestones. Life happens, and if unforeseen circumstances arise, I communicate proactively to keep you in the loop. When I commit to a deadline, I honor it—period. If circumstances beyond my control prevent timely delivery, I automatically discount my rate as a gesture of accountability. Your project deserves both quality and reliability, and I deliver both.

###  <span style="color: White;"> **Trello/RecordKeeping**</span>
___
I will comply with most basic record keeping, if you expect some out-winded system for record keeping, I expect more pay. Systems I don't charge for record keeping tasks are Trello, Google docs, GitHub, and Pull/Push Requests.

### <span style="color: White;"> **Rojo/GitHub**</span>
___
 I have no issue setting up a repository for the game, doing it in studio, or Rojo.
