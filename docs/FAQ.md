### Pricing
   
My Prices are done by to metrics.


### Pricing
=== "Hourly"
    Standard Hourly Rates are <span style="font-size: 150%;">$14</span> USD an hour. This number is subject to change based on complexity. And duration.
=== "Total"
    I due also allow for priceing based on total or tasked based, This pricing is negoatated from the start. And I will provied you a priorty list, and a price list for each item.
=== "You Reached out to me"
    If I reached out to you, the price you listed is what I thought was fair.
=== "Percent Pay"
    Unless we've come to an agreement, I do not do percent pay unless the game is already showing revenue.

### What can you do?
If you name it I can do it or figure it out. If you ask me if I have done it before I will be Upfront. But not doing one thing specifically doesn't mean I can't do it entierly.


### Communication
I tried to reach out daily baring any family, or life issues. If I accept a project with a deadline I will finish it by the deadline or I will discount the price.


### Trello/RecordKeeping
I will comply with most basic record keeping, if you expect some outwinded system for recored keeping, I expect more pay. Systems I dont charge for recored keeping tassks. Trello, google docs, GitHub, Pull/Push Requests.

### Rojo/GitHub
I have no issue setting up a repistory for the game, doing it in studio, or Rojo.
