### Pricing
   
My Prices are done by a few metrics.


### Pricing
=== "Hourly"
    Standard Hourly Rates are <span style="font-size: 150%;">$14</span> USD an hour. This number is subject to change based on complexity, and duration.
=== "Total"
    I due also allow for priceing based on total or tasked based, This pricing is negoatated from the start. And I will provied you a priorty list, and a price list for each item.
=== "You Reached out to me"
    If I reached out to you, the price you listed is what I thought was fair.
=== "Percent Pay"
    Unless we've come to an agreement, I do not do percent pay unless the game is already showing revenue.

### What can you do?
If you name it, I can do it, or figure it out. If you ask me if I have done it before, I will be upfront and honest, but not doing one thing specifically doesn't mean I can't do it entirely.


### Communication
I try to reach out daily barring any family, or life issues. If I accept a project with a deadline, I will finish it by the deadline, or I will discount the price.


### Trello/RecordKeeping
I will comply with most basic record keeping, if you expect some out-winded system for record keeping, I expect more pay. Systems I don't charge for record keeping tasks are Trello, Google docs, GitHub, and Pull/Push Requests.

### Rojo/GitHub
I have no issue setting up a repository for the game, doing it in studio, or Rojo.
