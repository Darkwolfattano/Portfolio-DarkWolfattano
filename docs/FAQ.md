I offer flexible, transparent pricing structures designed to accommodate projects of all sizes and budgets. My rates are calculated using multiple metrics to ensure you receive fair, competitive pricing tailored to your specific needs.

    Standard Hourly Rates are <span style="font-size: 150%;">$14</span> USD an hour. This number is subject to change based on complexity, and duration.

    I due also allow for priceing based on total or tasked based, This pricing is negoatated from the start. And I will provied you a priorty list, and a price list for each item.
=== "You Reached out to me"
    If I reached out to you, the price you listed is what I thought was fair.

### What can you do?
My versatility as a developer means I can tackle virtually any Roblox development challenge you present. Whether you need complex game mechanics, intricate UI systems, multiplayer networking, or custom scripting solutions, I have the skills and determination to deliver. If I encounter something new, I approach it with enthusiasm and quickly master the necessary techniques. I believe in transparent communication—if I haven't built something before, I'll tell you honestly, but I've consistently proven my ability to learn and implement new systems efficiently. My track record speaks for itself: challenges are just opportunities for innovation.


### Communication
Professional communication is a cornerstone of my work ethic. I maintain daily contact with clients throughout project development, keeping you informed of progress, challenges, and milestones. Life happens, and if unforeseen circumstances arise, I communicate proactively to keep you in the loop. When I commit to a deadline, I honor it—period. If circumstances beyond my control prevent timely delivery, I automatically discount my rate as a gesture of accountability. Your project deserves both quality and reliability, and I deliver both.


### Trello/RecordKeeping
I will comply with most basic record keeping, if you expect some out-winded system for record keeping, I expect more pay. Systems I don't charge for record keeping tasks are Trello, Google docs, GitHub, and Pull/Push Requests.

### Rojo/GitHub
I have no issue setting up a repository for the game, doing it in studio, or Rojo.
